## Logistic regression

This is the third chapter including logistic regression analysis.


First, I read the data from URL and explored basic structure and dimensions
```{r}
# Read data from URL

alc <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/alc.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)

str(alc)
dim(alc)

```
The data has 382 rows and 35 variables
Variables are integers, factors and one is boolean statement
