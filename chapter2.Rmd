# Regression analysis

*Second week, I did the data wrangling exercise and build small regression analysis on given data.*

- First, I got data from URL to data frame

```{r}
# Read data from URL

my_data <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/learning2014.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)



dim(my_data)

str(my_data)

```
-The result shows that the data has 166 rows and 7 variables. Seems as intended.

-Next, I did some prelimary visualizations just to get understanding of the data

```{r}
# initialize plot with data and aesthetic mapping
p1 <- ggplot(my_data, aes(x = age, y = points, col = gender))

# define the visualization type (points)
p2 <- p1 + geom_point()

p2
```
