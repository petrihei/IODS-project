# Regression analysis

*Second week, I did the data wrangling exercise and build small regression analysis on given data.*

- First, I imported the libraries and got data from URL to data frame

```{r}

# Access the dplyr and ggplot2 libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)

# Read data from URL

my_data <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/learning2014.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)



dim(my_data)

str(my_data)

```
-The result shows that the data has 166 rows and 7 variables. Seems as intended.

-Next, I did summary visualizations just to get understanding of the data

```{r}
# create advanced plot matrix with ggpairs()
p <- ggpairs(learning2014, mapping = aes(col=gender), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))

# draw the plot
p
```
